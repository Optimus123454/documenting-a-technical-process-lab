# How to Convert Your First Person Mouse Sensitivity from One Game to Another  
  
This process involves entering in known data into a web-page calculator that will do some simply calculations to convert a mouse sensitivity from one game into an as close as possible 1 to 1 sensitivity for another game. Not all games use the same algebra calculations to determine mouse sensitivity and character rotation. So a tool like this can be necessary for users who wish to have a 1 to 1 mouse sensitivity across multiple games.    
## Required resources:  
- Internet access  
- Web browser access  
- Two games with First Person mouse sensitivity settings  
- Known mouse DPI (Dots Per Inch) values  
- Known in game sensitivity setting from the game you are converting from 
- Names of the games you will be converting sensitivity TO and FROM  
## Step by step process

2. Navigate to [https://gamingsmart.com/mouse-sensitivity-converter/](https://gamingsmart.com/mouse-sensitivity-converter/)  
3. Select from the first drop down menu your chosen game that you will be converting a sensitivity FROM    
4. Select from the second drop down menu your chosen game that you will be converting a sensitivy TO  
5. Enter the in game sensitivity setting from your chosen game that you will be converting FROM  (You can either type in the value within the box, or use the up/down arrows provided)  
6. Enter your mouse DPI setting, and if you wish to also change your DPI, enter a new DPI setting (this value can be found either in your mouse manufacturers official documentation or within any software that comes bundled with the mouse)  
7. The web page will calculate and display your in game sensitivity setting below  
8. Open your chosen game and navigate to the sensitivity settings and enter the value provided by the webpage
